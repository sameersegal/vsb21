The trees, their shadows, the flowers and grass growing here, the dried leaves on the ground in Valley, for me all these are like an invitation to Valley. For me, the presence of the children and the teachers are the beauty of this place. Their presence and their sounds are like dewdrops and butterflies that make this place more special. The children all are the true guardian angles of this place. When you walk around Valley, you can feel their presence long after they have left. Each and everyone living on the campus these days can still feel their liveliness. Valley is missing their presence. 

During the present times, with the increasing confusion and anguish, what is that we need? What is the personal learning in all this? I draw my strength from the trees. Every time when I look at the trees that are here, many older than Valley, I get reminded of the timeless quality of the trees. For me, this is the learning of this place. The place shows me learning about living. The inert quality of trees shows us to explore the timeless quality within us.
