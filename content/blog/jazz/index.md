To all of us, Valley is a magic potion, an elixir that constantly infuses life, warmth and affection. The ingredients of this potions are many – the trees, the wildlife, the insects, the water bodies, the children, the adults and an innate sacredness that cannot be described. We have all drank this magic potion and feel grateful and feel joyous that we are its ingredients too, for without any of the components Valley won’t be what it is. 

It is such a delight to celebrate Valley’s birthday.
