When I joined Valley about 10 years back, I was surprised to see that ‘school’s birthday’ is celebrated here. Gradually, I realized these designated days help us individually to ask ourselves what does this place mean to me ‘today ‘. 

With the school being a little over 40 years old, surely it is time that each one asks oneself these:    

* Am I getting caught up and looking forward to rituals in a repetitive manner?
* How do I make sure that my connection to this place remains alive and active so that I look beyond what it had been in the past?
* Even when we go on doing the same thing every year is it necessary that it becomes mechanical? 

The circumstances this year have forced us to see things differently, we should be careful not to lose this ability to see things differently.
 
Happy birthday to all of us!
