# Dear Valley

Do you know it's your birthday!<br/>
I know you laugh at all such thoughts.<br/>
You were always there.<br/>
We came to stay with you this day.<br/>
And, we needed an excuse to celebrate.<br/>
Pray, it has rained and you are drenched<br/>
in Heaven's affection.<br/>
Pray, the lakes are full and the streams<br/>
are flowing.<br/>
Hope the birds are rejoicing and <br/>
the elephants are safe.<br/>
Pray, the panther can still hide<br/>
and the deer take refuge.<br/>
Are the trees glistening in the sun<br/>
Are the rocks shining bright.<br/>
Pray, you preserve the child's<br/>
smile innocent,<br/>
And they in turn see the sky,<br/>
hidden wild-flowers filled with dew drops<br/>
away from the paths.<br/>
Pray, the grown-ups are joyous<br/>
in their learning and <br/>
sharing affection.<br/>
Oh! Valley you have been<br/>
a blessing unto me and  all humanity.<br/>
Let's dance around the banyan and neem<br/>
and fill the skies with rainbows divine.<br/>
Let’s chant and demolish<br/>
all evil, ghosts and hells unseen.<br/>
Let's sing to the saplings new<br/>
and the seeds unborn.<br/>
Let’s pray for that sacredness<br/>
for which you were found.<br/>
Oh! Valley<br/>
Bless Us All Now.<br/>
