    - Do you know it's your birthday!
    - I know you laugh at all such thoughts.
    - You were always there.
    - We came to stay with you this day.
    - And, we needed an excuse to celebrate.
    - Pray, it has rained and you are drenched
    - in Heaven's affection.
    - Pray, the lakes are full and the streams
    - are flowing.
    - Hope the birds are rejoicing and 
    - the elephants are safe.
    - Pray, the panther can still hide
    - and the deer take refuge.
    - Are the trees glistening in the sun
    - Are the rocks shining bright.
    - Pray, you preserve the child's
    - smile innocent,

    - And they in turn see the sky,
    - hidden wild-flowers filled with dewdrops
    - away from the paths.
    - Pray, the grown-ups are joyous
    - in their learning and 
    - sharing affection.
    - Oh! Valley you have been
    - a blessing unto me and  all humanity.
    - Let's dance around the banyan and neem
    - and fill the skies with rainbows divine.
    - Let’s chant and demolish
    - all evil, ghosts and hells unseen.
    - Let's sing to the saplings new
    - and the seeds unborn.
    - Let’s pray for that sacredness
    - for which you were found.
    - Oh! Valley
    - Bless Us All Now.
