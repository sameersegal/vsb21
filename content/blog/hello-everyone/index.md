Hello everyone. 
As we sit together in this most sacred of places on the happy occasion of the school’s birthday, we must take a moment to remember Krishnamurti’s intent for the school when he started it. And we must all work together to stay true to that intent. 
The trees of Valley, the Banyan Tree, the Study Centre, the birds and all other creatures that live here, have witnessed many magical moments of peace, restfulness and serenity here. I wish that you all students – past and present, experience these enriching moments as well. 
I wish you all happiness and joy in life and my best wishes to you all on this happy day.
